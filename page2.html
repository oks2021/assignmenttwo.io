		<H1 id-"A0">Getting Started</H1>
		<p title="Getting started">Experienced birders may appear daunting with their heavy equipment or field gear, but really, all you need are your eyes, ears and some patience. Of course a handy pair of binoculars or a camera with a zoom function will help.</p>
		<p>First-time bird watchers should head to our gardens, nature areas and parks from around 7 am to 9 am. While you may spot birds at any time, early mornings are usually recommended as most birds are active during this period.</p>
		<p><strong>Where are the birds?</strong><br>
Parks and nature areas can head to include Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, a haven for migratory birds, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, a primary rainforest with a high degree of biodiversity, and Labrador Park, which attracts a great number of sea birds. <a target="_blank" href="page3.html">Here is a list of places</a> that

		<H1>Be A Bird Detective</H1>
		<p title="Be a bird detective">Once you are watching a bird, it’s time to play detective. Each bird you see is a mystery for your family to solve. And like any detective, you have to search for clues and gather evidence to help you solve each mystery. Here are things to look for.</p>
		<p><strong>What are its field marks?</strong><br>
“Field mark” is the term that birders use to describe something unique about a particular species of bird. Field marks are the clues that will help you put a name to a mystery bird. The first thing that most people notice about a bird is its color, but there are a lot of other field marks.</p>
		<p>Sometimes you need only one clue to identify a mystery bird, but often you need several clues to find the answer. Here’s a list of the most important types of field marks to consider:</p>

		<p><b>Colour:</b> There are completely red birds (male cardinals) and completely black birds (crows), but most birds are a combination of colors. Remember to look at the pattern of dark and light areas on a bird, as well as its colors. Can you see streaks on the chest, spots on the wings, or a white tail? Noticing these patterns can help you tell similar birds apart.</P>
		<p><b>Size:</b> It helps to compare a new bird to a common one you already know. For instance, is it bigger than a robin or smaller than a robin? Try thinking of it this way.</p>
		<p><b>Shape:</b> What shape is the bird? Is it tall and slender with long legs for wading in the water? Does it have a crest like the White-Crested Laughing Thrush? Or is it small with short legs for hopping on the ground? What is the shape of its bill? You might not be able to give your mystery bird a name just by looking at its shape, but you can often figure out what type of bird it is. For instance, that tall bird with long legs might be a heron and that small bird with short legs hopping on the ground is probably a sparrow.</p>
		<!--<p><b>Behaviour:</b> -->
		<p><b>Voice:</b> Voice, songs and call notes can be as important as visual clues. Each bird species has its own special calls. Some birds have such memorable songs that they are named for them. Chickadees really do go chick-a-deedee-dee and the Eastern Phoebe calls out fee-bee. Some experienced birders can identify birds just by their calls. Even if you don’t recognize a bird’s song, it’s a great clue to where it may be hiding.</p>
